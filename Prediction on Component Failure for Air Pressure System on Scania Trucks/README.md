**Scenario:**

Been retained by a haulage company to analyze a dataset based on data collected from**
heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurized air that is utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The dataset’s positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the APS. The data consists of a subset of all available data, selected by experts. This analysis will help determine the investment strategy for the company in the upcoming year.

The company’s CTO also requires you to rationalize all the decisions made in the report.

**Goals**

\- Conducting the analysis and report on findings:

\- Characterisation of the data set: size; the number of attributes; has/does not have missing values, number of observations.

\- Application of Data preparation/evaluation methods (Cleaning, renaming, etc) and EDA visualizations, including an explanation of the rationale for what I am doing with the data and why I am doing it.

\- Using PCA to establish the minimum number of features needed for retaining 99.5% variance in the data and then implementing PCA to dimensionally reduce the data to the number of features discovered. Including an explanation of the rationale for what I am doing with the data and why I am doing it.

\- Explaining what is the “Curse of Dimensionality” and how it may affect the analysis going forward.

\- Conclusions, Findings of data set, and references.
